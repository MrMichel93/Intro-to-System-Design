## How to Use Case Studies

1. **Read the problem statement** - Understand requirements
2. **Study the solution** - See how it's actually built
3. **Analyze trade-offs** - Why these choices?
4. **Compare alternatives** - What else could work?
5. **Practice** - Design a similar system yourself

## Learning from Real Systems

Each case study includes:
- **Problem Statement**: What needs to be built?
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional
- **Architecture**: High-level design
- **Key Components**: Detailed breakdown
- **Data Models**: How data is structured
- **Scale Numbers**: Actual metrics
- **Trade-offs**: Design decisions explained
- **Evolution**: How the system changed over time

## Next Steps

- Start with [Twitter](./twitter.md) for a comprehensive example
- Try [Design Templates](../design-templates/) for reusable patterns
- Practice with [Interview Prep](../interview-prep/) questions
