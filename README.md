# Introduction to System Design

Welcome to **Introduction to System Design**! This repository is designed to help students aged 16-20 learn the fundamentals of system design through clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on challenges.

## 📚 What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's about understanding how to build scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems that can handle real-world demands.

## 🎯 Who is This For?

This course is designed for:
- Students aged 16-20 with basic programming knowledge
- Anyone interested in understanding how large-scale applications work
- Students preparing for technical interviews or computer science studies

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, functions, loops, and conditionals)

## 📖 Course Structure

Each topic is organized into its own folder containing:
- **README.md**: Detailed explanation of the concept with examples
- **challenges.md**: Practice questions and challenges to test your understanding

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

1. **[Scalability](./01-scalability/)** - Learn how systems grow to handle millions of users
2. **[Load Balancing](./02-load-balancing/)** - Distribute traffic across multiple servers
3. **[Caching](./03-caching/)** - Speed up applications by storing frequently accessed data
4. **[Database Design](./04-database-design/)** - Design efficient and scalable databases
5. **[API Design](./05-api-design/)** - Create clean and maintainable APIs
6. **[Microservices](./06-microservices/)** - Break down large applications into smaller services
7. **[Message Queues](./07-message-queues/)** - Enable asynchronous communication between services
8. **[Content Delivery Networks](./08-cdn/)** - Deliver content faster to users worldwide

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the first topic and progress sequentially
2. Read the README in each folder to understand the concept
3. Complete the challenges to reinforce your learning
4. Take your time - system design is a broad topic that requires practice
5. Try to relate concepts to applications you use daily (social media, streaming services, etc.)

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Think at Scale**: Always consider what happens when millions of users interact with a system
- **Trade-offs**: Every design decision has pros and cons - learn to identify them
- **Practice**: Try designing systems for applications you use (YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- **Ask Questions**: If something isn't clear, research it further or discuss with peers
