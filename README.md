# Introduction to System Design

Welcome to **Introduction to System Design**! This repository is designed to help students aged 16-20 learn the fundamentals of system design through clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on challenges.

## 📚 What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's about understanding how to build scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems that can handle real-world demands.

## 🎯 Who is This For?

This course is designed for:
- Students aged 16-20 with basic programming knowledge
- Anyone interested in understanding how large-scale applications work
- Students preparing for technical interviews or computer science studies

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, functions, loops, and conditionals)

## 📖 Course Structure

Each module is organized into its own folder containing:
- **README.md**: Comprehensive explanation of the concept with real-world examples
- **examples.md**: Detailed real-world examples and case studies
- **design-exercise.md**: Hands-on design problems to practice
- **trade-offs.md**: Analysis of design trade-offs and decision-making
- **diagrams/**: Visual representations and ASCII diagrams

**Practice & Application**
- Work through **[case-studies](./case-studies/)** to see real systems
- Use **[design-templates](./design-templates/)** for your own designs
- Prepare for interviews with **[interview-prep](./interview-prep/)**

### Study Tips:
- Read the main README in each module first
- Review real-world examples to understand practical applications
- Complete design exercises hands-on
- Analyze trade-offs to develop decision-making skills
- Take your time - system design requires practice and reflection

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Think at Scale**: Always consider what happens when millions of users interact with a system
- **Trade-offs**: Every design decision has pros and cons - learn to identify them
- **Practice**: Try designing systems for applications you use (YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- **Ask Questions**: If something isn't clear, research it further or discuss with peers
