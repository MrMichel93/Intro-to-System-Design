- Presentation (15-20 slides)

**Project Options:**
1. Real-Time Collaboration Platform (like Google Docs)
2. Food Delivery Platform (like Uber Eats)
3. Video Streaming Platform (like YouTube)
4. E-Commerce Marketplace (like Amazon)
5. Social Media Platform (like Instagram)
6. Custom Proposal (subject to approval)

**Deliverables:**
- Complete design document with capacity estimates, API design, architecture
- Professional diagrams (high-level, data flow, database, deployment, sequence)
- Presentation slides with Q&A preparation

**Time Commitment:** 10-15 hours over 2-3 weeks

**Grading:**
- Written Document: 60 points
- Diagrams: 20 points
- Presentation: 20 points
- Bonus: Up to 10 points
- **Total: 100 points (110 with bonus)**
